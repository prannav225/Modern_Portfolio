# Naga Pranav M // Modern Portfolio

A high-priority, "Studio-grade" portfolio website built with a focus on **Architectural Engineering** and **Glassmorphism Design**. This project leverages modern web standards to deliver a premium, high-performance experience that bridges the gap between enterprise reliability and creative motion design.

---

## Design Philosophy

The site is built on a custom **Studio Aesthetic**:

- **Architectural Clarity:** Strong use of whitespace and high-contrast typography.
- **Structural Glassmorphism:** Every interactive card and container utilizes a `backdrop-blur-3xl` system to create tangible depth.
- **Micro-Interactions:** Subtle button glows, smooth height-aligned grids, and deliberate entry animations using Framer Motion.
- **Dynamic Previews:** A hybrid screenshot system that renders live website previews via Microlink API.

---

## Technical Stack

- **Core:** React 19 + Vite (Next-gen performance)
- **Styling:** Tailwind CSS 4.0 (Modern utility-first architecture)
- **Animation:** Framer Motion (Orchestrated motion design)
- **Layout:** Lenis (Global smooth scrolling)
- **Icons:** Lucide React (Stroke-based minimalist iconography)
- **Previews:** Microlink API (Automated dynamic project screenshots)

---

## Key Features

- **Pill-Nav Navigation:** A high-end, responsive pill-shaped navbar with glassmorphism and scroll-triggered states.
- **Hybrid Gallery:** A project showcase that intelligently falls back to static optimized images if dynamic previews encounter latency.
- **Studio-Grid UI:** Perfectly aligned, height-matched career and technical stack blocks.
- **Optimized Hero:** A single-viewport hero section designed to fit critical information (Bio, Availability, Work Link) within 100% of the mobile screen height.
- **P2P Showcase:** Dedicated sections for high-performance projects like **Getransfr** (WebRTC/FileSystem API).
